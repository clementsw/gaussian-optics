# gaussian-optics
Simple matlab toolkit for manipulating Gaussian quantum states of light (see for example "Continuous variable quantum information: Gaussian states and beyond" by G. Adesso for more information), which I developed for small-scale experimentation during my PhD. Includes an implementation of the method to calculate photon number statistics for arbitrary multimode Gaussian states from "Multidimensional Hermite polynomials and photon distributions for polymode mixed light", by Dodonov et al, PRA 1994.

The code is quite straightforward, and example uses can be found in examples.m. I have tested it in Matlab 2014, but I don't know how compatible it is with other versions of Matlab.

Feel free to use any part of it that can help with your work.
