# gaussian-optics
Matlab toolkit for manipulating Gaussian quantum states of light (see for example "Continuous variable quantum information: Gaussian states and beyond" by G. Adesso for more information), which I used for small-scale experimentation during my PhD.

The code is quite straightforward, and example uses can be found in examples.m
